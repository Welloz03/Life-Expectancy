# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction Project 📈

Welcome to the **Life Expectancy Prediction** project! This project involves building and optimizing machine learning models to predict life expectancy using various socioeconomic, environmental, and health-related features.

## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:
- **Explore**: Analyze a dataset containing diverse factors influencing life expectancy.
- **Build**: Develop and optimize machine learning models.
- **Evaluate**: Assess model performance using various metrics.

This project was developed using **Python** libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `NumPy` for data manipulation, model building, and analysis.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and normalized data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added/modified features to improve model performance.
- **Visualization**: Generated visualizations to understand feature relationships with life expectancy.
